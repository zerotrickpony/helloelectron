## TODOs

- ✅ get ts working in main process in a basic way
- ✅ try compiled.js and see if source map works in renderer
- ✅ make a "just the web" compilation script
- ✅ try using "sass" for CSS compilation: https://sass-lang.com/guide/#example-variables-scss
- ✅ ErrorReport class
- ✅ Type safe command dispatch using some sort of IDL or common interface
- ✅ try packaging
- ✅ port the scripts to node.js
- ✅ strip out the source map from electronpreload.js to get rid of the error message
- ✅ write out updateinfo.json as part of packaging
- ✅ Logger facility
- ✅ rename HtmlBuilder to something more pithy like DBox or DomBox or DivBox or NodeBox.
- ✅ try using a native dependency like better-sqlite3, and add the electron rebuild statement to the script
- ✅ get tests working
  - ✅ compile a version of the app with the test code in it
  - ✅ make sure that code in test can refer to prod code
  - ✅ rewrite require statements and reparent the test code
  - ✅ fix up paths in the source map files for the test code
  - ✅ generate hooks that register all the tests (does module code run? maybe i could generate includes)
  - ✅ launch and make sure it sort of works
  - ✅ testing harness that sets up the code each time
  - ✅ bring in test/websrc source for debugger
  - ✅ run just one test, pick from the command line
  - ✅ open dev console on test failure
  - ✅ test/data redeployments
  - ✅ just pass actual argv to the process during the test, dont use fakeArgv? testsetup.json
  - ✅ consider any crash anywhere in the app to also be a test failure.
  - need to put a test/node_modules and a test/package.json in there
- ✅ updater scheme / OTA update support
- test/ needs to be split up from testweb/, they cant share a single node_modules.
- add dpdm and run it during tests
- bug: restart app button in crash reporter doesnt work
- try npm install non-dev web dependencies, what happens to them?
- add toasts to the GUI, and toast on update
- add wrapper scripts for "npm install --save"
- test updater on mac
- test packaging: Linux
  - linux packager has wrong path, it should refer to the .deb not the zip
- test packaging: Win
  - add Windows signing instructions and setup
  - test updater
- test packaging: Mac x64
- notarization for macos
- the default behavior of the app shows an ugly printout, this is not a good demo.
